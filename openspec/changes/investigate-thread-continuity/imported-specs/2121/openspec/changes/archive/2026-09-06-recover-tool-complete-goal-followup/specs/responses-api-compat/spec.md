+## ADDED Requirements
+
+### Requirement: Exact tool-manifest replay preserves fresh user follow-up
+
+When a fingerprint-verified durable input prefix is followed by every call and
+matching output in the durable prior-response pending-tool manifest, the
+full-resend context proof SHALL permit trailing self-contained user input after
+that complete batch. The proof MUST require exact call IDs and call types,
+complete settlement, no duplicate or orphan result, and no call-ID collision
+with the stored prefix. It MUST reject user input interleaved with the batch or
+any later call, output, or instruction-role message after the fresh-input suffix
+begins. The existing bounded developer-interleave exception MUST NOT gain a
+trailing-input extension.
+
+Account switching MUST still require the complete projected request to pass
+account-neutral replay classification, the durable prefix to match, and the
+existing pre-dispatch recovery and account-scope checks. A qualifying replay
+MUST retain the complete calls, outputs, and fresh input. This proof MUST NOT
+authorize transferring encrypted compaction, account-owned files, conversation
+references, or an unverified input prefix.
+
+#### Scenario: Goal follow-up after completed tool batch can leave exhausted owner
+
+- **GIVEN** the input contains a verified stored prefix and exactly settles its durable pending-tool manifest
+- **AND** a self-contained goal-continuation user message follows the complete tool batch
+- **WHEN** the previous owner is unavailable before dispatch and the complete projected body is account-neutral
+- **THEN** the bridge can use its existing fresh replay path on another eligible account
+- **AND** it retains the calls, results, and goal instruction without the old response anchor
+
+#### Scenario: Fresh input does not conceal a missing parallel result
+
+- **GIVEN** a durable manifest contains multiple calls
+- **WHEN** a resend appends user input after only part of the recorded batch
+- **THEN** context proof fails and cross-account replay remains forbidden
+
+#### Scenario: New input does not relax developer-interleave bounds
+
+- **GIVEN** a suffix uses the existing three-item custom-call/developer/output exception
+- **WHEN** additional user input follows that suffix
+- **THEN** this exception remains ineligible for exact-manifest proof
+
